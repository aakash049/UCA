------------------------------------------------ ABSTRACT CLASS & ABSTRACT METHODS ----------------------------------------------------------
Abstract function cannot reside in a non-abstract class but a non-abstract class can have 0 or more non-abstract functions in it.

in case of interface, all data members are 'public final static'

"static final" will behave as c++ macro.

a function cannot be more restrictive than it's base class.

cannot override functions marked as final or static.

checked exceptions ----> Exception Handler checked during compile time. (e.g. file handling)
unchecked exceptions -----> Exception Handler checked during runtime. (e.g. divide by 0)
