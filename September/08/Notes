class System {
    static Outstream out; // in System.out.println()
}

"is a" / "has a" relationship

in java final is same as c++ const

final can be initialised at the time of declaration / using constructor only

cannot override final

final can be a function or even a class.

cannot inherit final class.

cannot override final method

static variables are given memory in "method area".

static functions can access only static data members.

static functions can call functions which require objects by passing object as parameter.

static initializer block. executes before main (during load time)

e.g ---------->      static {
                        --------
                     }

purpose of static initializer block is to initialize static members.

whenever we make a parameterised constructor , we should always try to create a non parameterised constructor too.

this can be used to call a different parameterised constructor within one constructor.
